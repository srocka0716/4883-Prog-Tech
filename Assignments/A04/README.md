Honestly i feel like since youve used online judge majorly in the past that we should continue to try and use it since its familiar. I have trauma from the go-lang course where we were all on uncharted ground, lol. I am one of the people, however, that couldnt seem to log in to uva online judge.

Given that many of us couldnt use it and are likely still unable to log in, i think out of the list we should probably go with something like kattis. It looks like it is the most similar to online judge. And also maybe im just stupid but im kind of terrified of trying to build something, I have terrible luck trying to do anything from scratch in your classes and a giant fear of confrotation, lol.

I do love the idea us creating our own problems for the rest of the class to solve. I think its fun when we have creative liberty in our projects, and i already have a fun idea!
